I'm a fan of Bruno Mars, so I decided to perform a short exploratory analysis of his music over the years. Using the Genius API, I collected 28 song lyrics from his three studio albums: *Doo-Wops & Hooligans* (2010), *Unorthodox JukeBox* (2012), and *24K Magic* (2016). He has released more songs than I currently have in my corpus, but it's more than enough to develop interesting insights.

Following extensive text preprocessing, I created word clouds to visualize the most frequent words in each album. This can be viewed in *Data Analysis (Part 1).ipynb.*
