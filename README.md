I'm a fan of Bruno Mars, so I decided to perform an exploratory analysis of his music over the years. Using the Genius API, I collected 28 song lyrics from his three studio albums: *Doo-Wops & Hooligans* (2010), *Unorthodox JukeBox* (2012), and *24K Magic* (2016). 

Following text preprocessing, I created word clouds to visualize word frequencies in each album. The word "love" appears significantly more in *XX4K* than the first two albums. As expected, the results of my sentiment analysis showed that most of Bruno Mars' songs are predominantly positive. *Liquor Store Blues* and *Talking to the Moon* have lower percentages of positive words on average. These two songs artificially deflated the overall positivity of *Doo-Wops & Hooligans*. Exact scores from the sentiment analysis can be found in *Data Analysis.ipynb."

Because my corpus consists of only one artist, the song lyrics are very homogenous in nature; it was a little bit challenging to develop more interesting insights. Perhaps I should have compared different artists or collected songs from multiple genres. Having looked at similar projects online, many people actually analyze larger volumes of song lyrics---not just from one artist. Nonetheless, as someone who's transitioning from R to Python, I now feel very comfortable using Python.
