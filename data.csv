Grenade,"[Verse 1]
Easy come, easy go, that's just how you live, oh
Take, take, take it all, but you never give
Shoulda known you was trouble from the first kiss
Had your eyes wide open; why were they open? (Ooh)

[Pre-Chorus]
Gave you all I had and you tossed it in the trash
You tossed it in the trash, you did
To give me all your love is all I ever ask
'Cause what you don't understand is

[Chorus]
I'd catch a grenade for ya (Yeah, yeah, yeah)
Throw my hand on a blade for ya (Yeah, yeah, yeah)
I'd jump in front of a train for ya (Yeah, yeah, yeah)
You know I'd do anything for ya (Yeah, yeah, yeah)
Oh, oh-oh oh oh, I would go through all this pain
Take a bullet straight through my brain
Yes, I would die for ya baby
But you won't do the same

[Post-Chorus]
No, no, no, no, oh-oh oh...

[Verse 2]
Black, black, black and blue, beat me 'til I'm numb
Tell the devil I said ""Hey"" when you get back to where you're from
Mad woman, bad woman, that's just what you are
Yeah, you'll smile in my face then rip the brakes out my car

[Pre-Chorus]
Gave you all I had and you tossed it in the trash
You tossed it in the trash; yes, you did!
To give me all your love is all I ever ask
'Cause what you don't understand is

[Chorus]
I'd catch a grenade for ya (Yeah, yeah, yeah)
Throw my hand on a blade for ya (Yeah, yeah, yeah)
I'd jump in front of a train for ya (Yeah, yeah, yeah)
You know I'd do anything for ya (Yeah, yeah, yeah)
Oh, oh-oh oh oh, I would go through all this pain
Take a bullet straight through my brain
Yes, I would die for ya, baby
But you won't do the same

[Bridge]
If my body was on fire
Ooh, you'd watch me burn down in flames
You said you loved me, you're a liar
Cause you never, ever, ever did, baby

[Chorus]
But darlin', I'd still catch a grenade for ya (Yeah, yeah, yeah)
Throw my hand on a blade for ya (Yeah, yeah, yeah)
I'd jump in front of a train for ya (Yeah, yeah, yeah)
You know I'd do anything for ya (Yeah, yeah, yeah)
Oh, oh-oh oh-oh, I would go through all this pain
Take a bullet straight through my brain
Yes, I would die for ya, baby
But you won't do the same

[Outro]
No, you won't do the same
You wouldn't do the same
Ooh, you'd never do the same
No, no, no, no oh-oh oh"
Just the Way You Are,"[Verse 1]
Oh, her eyes, her eyes
Make the stars look like they're not shinin'
Her hair, her hair
Falls perfectly without her trying
She's so beautiful
And I tell her every day
Yeah, I know, I know
When I compliment her she won't believe me
And it's so, it's so
Sad to think that she don't see what I see
But every time she asks me, ""Do I look okay?""
I say

[Chorus]
When I see your face
There's not a thing that I would change
'Cause you're amazing just the way you are
And when you smile
The whole world stops and stares for a while
'Cause, girl, you're amazing just the way you are

[Verse 2]
Her lips, her lips
I could kiss them all day if she'd let me
Her laugh, her laugh
She hates but I think it's so sexy
She's so beautiful, and I tell her every day
Oh you know, you know, you know
I'd never ask you to change
If perfect's what you're searching for
Then just stay the same
So don't even bother asking if you look okay
You know I'll say

[Chorus]
When I see your face
There's not a thing that I would change
'Cause you're amazing just the way you are
And when you smile
The whole world stops and stares for a while
'Cause, girl, you're amazing just the way you are

[Post-Chorus]
The way you are
The way you are
Girl, you're amazing just the way you are

[Chorus]
When I see your face
There's not a thing that I would change
'Cause you're amazing just the way you are
And when you smile
The whole world stops and stares for a while
'Cause, girl, you're amazing just the way you are, yeah"

Today, I don't feel like doing anything

Don't feel like picking up my phone
So leave a message at the tone

I'm gonna kick my feet up, then stare at the fan
Turn the TV on, throw my hand in my pants

Talking to the Moon,"[Verse 1]
I know you're somewhere out there
Somewhere far away
I want you back, I want you back
My neighbors think I'm crazy
But they don't understand
You're all I have, you're all I have

[Pre-Chorus]
At night when the stars light up my room
I sit by myself...

[Chorus]
Talking to the moon
Trying to get to you
In hopes you're on the other side talking to me too
Or am I a fool, who sits alone, talking to the moon?

[Verse 2]
I'm feeling like I'm famous, the talk of the town
They say I've gone mad
Yeah, I've gone mad
But they don't know what I know
Cause when the sun goes down someone's talking back
Yeah, they're talking back, oh

[Pre-Chorus]
At night when the stars light up my room
I sit by myself...

[Chorus]
Talking to the moon
Trying to get to you
In hopes you're on the other side talking to me too
Or am I a fool, who sits alone, talking to the moon?

[Bridge]
Do you ever hear me calling?
Oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh
Cause every night, I'm talking to the moon

[Chorus]
Still trying to get to you
In hopes you're on the other side talking to me too
Or am I a fool, who sits alone, talking to the moon?

I know you're somewhere out there

Now greetings to da world (all of you)
Vye here is da one called Bruno Mars 'long side gong to da zilla
(Ya know me, I roll)

Standing at this liquor store
Whiskey coming through my pores
Feeling like I run this whole block
Lotto tickets, cheap beer
That's why you can catch me here
Tryna scratch my way up to the top

So I ain't got a thing to lose
Take me to a place where I don't care

One shot for my pain

So I'll be out here 'til they call the cops

The Other Side,"[Verse 1: Bruno Mars]
Truth of the matter is I'm complicated
You're as straight as they come
You go 'bout your day, baby
While I hide from the sun
It's better if you don't understand
Cause you won't know what it's like until you try

[Chorus: Bruno Mars]
You know I, I've been waiting on the other side
And you, all you gotta do is cross the line
I could wait a whole lifetime, but you just gotta decide
You know I, I've been waiting on the other
Waiting on the other side

[Verse 2: Cee-Lo Green]
We would live forever
Who could ask for more?
You could die if you wanted, but baby, what for?
It's better if you don't understand
And you won't know what it's like until you, try

[Chorus: Cee-Lo Green]
You know I, I've been waiting on the other side
And you, all you gotta do is cross the line
I could wait a whole lifetime, but you just gotta decide
You know I, I've been waiting on the other
Waiting on the other side

[Verse 3: B.o.B.]
If they say life's a dream, call this insomnia
Cause this ain't Wonderland, it damn sure ain't Narnia
And once you cross the line, you can't change your mind
Yeah, I'm a monster, but I'm no Frankenstein
And quite frankly, I've been feelin' insane in between my eyes
I really can't explain what I feel inside
If you knew what I was, you would run and hide
Many have tried to go into the night
Cross over the line, and come back alive
But that's the price we pay when we living on the other side

[Chorus: Bruno Mars]
You know I, I've been waiting on the other side
And you, all you gotta do is cross the line
I could wait a whole lifetime, but you just gotta decide
You know I, I've been waiting on the other
Waiting on the other side

[Outro: B.o.B]
It's better if you don't understand
It's better if you don't understand
It's better if you don't understand
It's better if you don't understand
It's better if you don't understand
It's better if you don't understand"
Young Girls,"[Verse 1]
I spend all my money
On a big, old fancy car
For these bright-eyed honeys
Oh yeah, you know who you are

I get lost under these lights
I get lost in the words I say

Like everything will be okay
Oh I still dream of a simple life

But love don't exist when you live like this
That much I know, yes I know

[Pre-Chorus]
All these roads steer me wrong
But I still drive them all night long
All night long

[Chorus]
All you young, wild girls

Hello
You know you look even better
Than the way you did the night before
And the moment that you kiss my lips
You know, I start to feel wonderful
It's something incredible
There's sex in your chemicals, oh

When I Was Your Man,"[Verse 1]
Same bed but it feels just a little bit bigger now
Our song on the radio but it don't sound the same
When our friends talk about you, all it does is just tear me down
'Cause my heart breaks a little when I hear your name

[Pre-Chorus]
It all just sounds like oooooh ooh
Mmm, too young, too dumb to realize

[Chorus]
That I should have bought you flowers
And held your hand
Should have gave you all my hours
When I had the chance
Take you to every party
'Cause all you wanted to do was dance
Now my baby's dancing
But she's dancing with another man

[Verse 2]
My pride, my ego, my needs, and my selfish ways
Caused a good, strong woman like you to walk out my life
Now I'll never, never get to clean up the mess I made (oh)
And it haunts me every time I close my eyes

[Pre-Chorus]
It all just sounds like oooooh ooh
Mmm, too young, too dumb to realize

[Chorus]
That I should have bought you flowers
And held your hand
Should have gave you all my hours
When I had the chance
Take you to every party
'Cause all you wanted to do was dance
Now my baby's dancing
But she's dancing with another man

[Bridge]
Although it hurts
I'll be the first to say that I was wrong
Oh, I know I'm probably much too late
To try and apologize for my mistakes
But I just want you to know

[Chorus]
I hope he buys you flowers
I hope he holds your hand
Give you all his hours
When he has the chance
Take you to every party
'Cause I remember how much you loved to dance
Do all the things I should have done
When I was your man

[Outro]
Do all the things I should have done
When I was your man"
Natalie,"[Verse 1]
Oh, I've never done this before
Never want to do this again
Wrong turn, on a dusty road
I did it to myself, I can't pretend
Well I learned just a little too late
Good God, I must have been blind
Cause she got me for everything
Everything, everything, alright
Like my daddy, I'm a gambling man
Never been afraid to roll the dice
But when I put my bet on her
Little Miss Snake Eyes ruined my life
She better sleep with one eye open
Better make sure to lock her doors
Cause once I get my hands on her, I'ma ooh

[Chorus]
Natalie, she ran away with all my money
And she did it for fun
Natalie, she's probably out there thinking it's funny
Telling everyone
Well, I'm digging a ditch for this gold digging bitch
Watch out, she's quick
Look out for a pretty little thing named Natalie
If you see her, tell her I'm coming
She better run

[Verse 2]
The good lord better bless your soul
Cause I done already cursed your name
Don't matter which way you go
Payback's gonna come your way
You'll be begging me, ""Please, please, please""
And I'ma look at you and laugh, laugh, laugh
While you sit there and cry for me, cry for me
Cry for me all night
I'll spend a life time in jail
(Yeah, that's what I'll do)
I'll be smiling in my cell
(Yeah, thinking 'bout you)
Can't nobody save you now
Sure there ain't no use in trying
Once I get my hands on you, I'ma ooh

[Chorus]
Natalie, she ran away with all my money
And she did it for fun
Natalie, she's probably out there thinking it's funny
Telling every one
Well, I'm digging a ditch for this gold digging bitch
Watch out, she's quick
Look out for a pretty little thing named Natalie
If you see her, tell her I'm coming
She better run

[Bridge]
I should've known better
(I should've known better)
Cause when we were together
(Cause when we were together)
She never said forever
(She never said forever)
I'm a fool that played in her game, hey!

[Chorus]
Natalie, she ran away with all my money
And she did it for fun
Natalie, she's probably out there thinking it's funny
Telling every one
Well, I'm digging a ditch for this gold digging bitch
Watch out, she's quick
Look out for a pretty little thing named Natalie
If you see her, tell her I'm coming

I watch the whole room change
Baby, that's what you do
No my baby don't play
Blame it on my confidence
Oh, blame it on your measurements
Shut that shit down on sight
That's right

[Chorus]
We out here drippin' in finesse
It don't make no sense
Out here drippin' in finesse
You know it, you know it
We out here drippin' in finesse
It don't make no sense
Out here drippin' in finesse
You know it, you know it

[Verse 2]
Now slow it down for me baby
'Cause I love the way it feels when we grind
Yeah, our connection's so magnetic on the floor
Nothing can stop us tonight

[Pre-Chorus]
When I'm walkin' with you
I watch the whole room change
Baby, that's what you do
No my baby don't play
Blame it on my confidence
Oh, blame it on your measurements
Shut that shit down on sight
That's right

[Chorus]
We out here drippin' in finesse
It don't make no sense
Out here drippin' in finesse
You know it, you know it
We out here drippin' in finesse
It don't make no sense
Out here drippin' in finesse
You know it, you know it

[Bridge]
Fellas, grab your ladies if your lady fine

Too Good to Say Goodbye,"[Verse 1]
I've made mistakes
I could have treated you better
I let you get away
There goes my happily ever after

[Pre-Chorus]
Tell me why, why can't we try and start again?
This can't be how our story ends
You're more than my girl, you're my best friend
Tell me you remember when
Ooh, when I was your man and you were my girl
It was you and me against the world

[Chorus]
Baby, ain't nobody gonna love me like the way you do
And you ain't never gonna find a love like mine
Tell me what can I do to make it up to you?
'Cause what we got's too good to say goodbye, goodbye

[Verse 2]
Yeah, I'm still in love with you darlin'
I know you feel the same
Oh, what's the point of both of us being broken-hearted?
I pray it's never too late

[Pre-Chorus]
So tell me, why, why can't we try and start again?
This can't be how our story ends
You're more than my girl, you're my best friend
Tell me you remember when
I was your man and you were my girl
It was you and me against the world

[Chorus]
Baby, ain't nobody gonna love me like the way you do
And you ain't never gonna find a love like mine
Tell me what can I do to make it up to you?
'Cause what we got's too good to say goodbye, goodbye

[Bridge]
(Oh, don't you give up)
Girl won't you listen?
(Don't you give up)
It's you that I'm missin'
(Don't you give up)
Take my hand, I wanna go, I wanna go
(All the way)
If we're gonna fight this fight for better days
I know we're gonna make it
This is the chance, let's take it

[Chorus]
Baby, ain't nobody gonna love me like the way you do
(No, no, no, no)
And you ain't never gonna find a love like mine
(Oh, tell me)
Tell me what can I do to make it up to you?
'Cause what we got's too good to say goodbye
(Come on, come on) goodbye (Oh baby, baby)
Baby, ain't nobody gonna love me like the way you do
And you ain't never gonna find a love like mine
(Oh, tell me)
Tell me what can I do to make it up to you?
'Cause what we got's too good to say goodbye, goodbye"
